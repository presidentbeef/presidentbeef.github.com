  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Backstory</h2>

<p>Recently, a friend asked me if <em>just</em> calling <code>constantize</code> on user input was dangerous, even if subsequent code did not use the result:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">params</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="ss">:class</span><span class="o">].</span><span class="n">classify</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">constantize</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><a href="https://brakemanscanner.org/">Brakeman</a> generates a &#8220;remote code execution&#8221; warning for this code:</p>

<pre>
<font color="#00C300">Confidence</font>: <font color="#AA0000">High</font>
<font color="#00C300">Category</font>: Remote Code Execution

<font color="#00C300">Line</font>: 7
</pre>


<p>But why? Surely just converting a string to a constant (if the constant even exists!) can&#8217;t be dangerous, right?</p>

<p>Coincidentally, around that same time I was looking at Ruby deserialization gadgets - in particular <a href="https://www.elttam.com/blog/ruby-deserialization/">this one</a> which mentions that Ruby&#8217;s <code>Digest</code> module will load a file based on the module name. For example, <code>Digest::A</code> will try to <code>require 'digest/a'</code>:</p>

<pre>2.7.0 :001 &gt; require <font color="#FF5555"><b>&apos;</b></font><font color="#AA0000">digest</font><font color="#FF5555"><b>&apos;</b></font>
 =&gt; <font color="#55FFFF"><b>true</b></font> 
2.7.0 :002 &gt; <font color="#5555FF"><u style="text-decoration-style:single"><b>Digest</b></u></font>::<font color="#5555FF"><u style="text-decoration-style:single"><b>Whatever</b></u></font>
<font color="#DEDEDE"><b>Traceback</b></font> (most recent call last):
        5: from /home/justin/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.7.0/bin/irb:23:in `&lt;main&gt;&apos;
        4: from /home/justin/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.7.0/bin/irb:23:in `load&apos;
        3: from /home/justin/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.7.0/lib/ruby/gems/2.7.0/gems/irb-1.2.1/exe/irb:11:in `&lt;top (required)&gt;&apos;
        2: from (irb):2
        1: from /home/justin/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.7.0/lib/ruby/2.7.0/digest.rb:16:in `const_missing&apos;
<font><b>LoadError (</b><u style="text-decoration-style:single"><b>library not found for class Digest::Whatever -- digest/whatever</b></u><b>)</b></font></pre>


<p>The <code>Digest</code> library uses the <a href="https://rdoc.info/stdlib/core/Module:const_missing"><code>const_missing</code></a> hook to implement this functionality.</p>

<p>This made me wonder if <code>constantize</code> and <code>const_missing</code> could be connected, and what the consequences would be.</p>

<h2>Constantizing in Rails</h2>

<p>The <code>constantize</code> method in Rails <a href="https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/String.html#method-i-constantize">turns a string into a constant</a>. If the constant does not exist then a <code>NameError</code> will be raised.</p>

<p>However, it is possible to hook into the constant lookup process in Ruby by defining a <code>const_missing</code> method. If a constant cannot be found in a given module, and that module has <code>const_missing</code> defined, then <code>const_missing</code> will be invoked.</p>

<pre>2.7.0 :001 &gt; <font color="#00C300">module</font> <font color="#5555FF"><u style="text-decoration-style:single"><b>X</b></u></font>
2.7.0 :002 &gt;   <font color="#00C300">def</font> <font color="#55FFFF"><b>self</b></font>.<font color="#5555FF"><b>const_missing</b></font>(name)
2.7.0 :003 &gt;     puts <font color="#FF5555"><b>&quot;</b></font><font color="#AA0000">You tried to load #{</font>name.inspect<font color="#AA0000">}</font><font color="#FF5555"><b>&quot;</b></font>
2.7.0 :004 &gt;   <font color="#00C300">end</font>
2.7.0 :005 &gt; <font color="#00C300">end</font>
 =&gt; <font color="#6C009B">:const_missing</font> 
2.7.0 :006 &gt; <font color="#5555FF"><u style="text-decoration-style:single"><b>X</b></u></font>::<font color="#5555FF"><u style="text-decoration-style:single"><b>Hello</b></u></font>
You tried to load :Hello
 =&gt; <font color="#55FFFF"><b>nil</b></font></pre>


<p>If <code>const_missing</code> is implemented with behavior based on the constant name, such as loading a file or creating a new object, there is an opportunity for malicious behavior.</p>

<h2>Some Vulnerable Gems</h2>

<p>Fortunately, <code>const_missing</code> is not used very often. When it is, the implementation is not usually exploitable.</p>

<p>Searching across ~1300 gems, I found only ~40 gems with a <code>const_missing</code> implementation.</p>

<p>Of those, the majority were not exploitable because they checked the constant name against expected values or called <code>const_get</code> which raises an exception if the constant does not exist.</p>

<p>One gem, <a href="https://github.com/rubychan/coderay">coderay</a>, <a href="https://github.com/rubychan/coderay/blob/d38502167541a1cd1b505a0e468e0098e3ae7538/lib/coderay/helpers/plugin_host.rb#L59-L67">loads files based on constant names</a> like the Digest library. Also like the Digest library, this does not appear to be exploitable because the files are limited to a single coderay directory.</p>

<p>The next two gems below have memory leaks, which can enable denial of service attacks through memory exhaustion.</p>

<h3>Temple</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/judofyr/temple">Temple</a> gem is a foundational gem used by Haml, Slim, and other templating libraries.</p>

<p>In Temple, there is a module called <code>Temple::Mixins::GrammarDSL</code> that implements <code>const_missing</code> like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">const_missing</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nb">const_set</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="no">Root</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nb">name</span><span class="p">))</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The method creates a new constant based on the given <code>name</code> and assigns a new object.</p>

<p>This is a memory leak since constants are never garbage collected. If an attacker can trigger it, they can create an unlimited number of permanent objects, using up as much memory as possible.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it is easy to exploit this code.</p>

<p><code>Temple::Grammar</code> extends <code>Template::Mixins::GrammarDSL</code> and is a core class for Temple. Let&#8217;s see if it is loaded by Haml, a popular templating library often used with Rails:</p>

<pre>2.7.0 :001 &gt; require <font color="#FF5555"><b>&apos;</b></font><font color="#AA0000">haml</font><font color="#FF5555"><b>&apos;</b></font>
 =&gt; <font color="#55FFFF"><b>true</b></font> 
2.7.0 :002 &gt; <font color="#5555FF"><u style="text-decoration-style:single"><b>Temple</b></u></font>::<font color="#5555FF"><u style="text-decoration-style:single"><b>Grammar</b></u></font>
 =&gt; <font color="#5555FF"><u style="text-decoration-style:single"><b>Temple</b></u></font>::<font color="#5555FF"><u style="text-decoration-style:single"><b>Grammar</b></u></font> </pre>


<p>Great! What happens if we try to reference a module that definitely does not exist?</p>

<pre>2.7.0 :003 &gt; <font color="#5555FF"><u style="text-decoration-style:single"><b>Temple</b></u></font>::<font color="#5555FF"><u style="text-decoration-style:single"><b>Grammar</b></u></font>::<font color="#5555FF"><u style="text-decoration-style:single"><b>DefinitelyDoesNotExist</b></u></font>
 =&gt; #&lt;Temple::Mixins::GrammarDSL::Root:0x000055a79b011060 @grammar=Temple::Grammar, @children=[], @name=:DefinitelyDoesNotExist&gt; </pre>


<p>As can be seen above, the constant is created along with a new object.</p>

<p>To go one step further&#8230; does the use of constantize invoke this code?</p>

<p>We can test by loading a Rails console for an application using Haml:</p>

<pre>Loading development environment (Rails 6.0.3.2)
2.7.0 :001 &gt; require <font color="#FF5555"><b>&apos;</b></font><font color="#AA0000">haml</font><font color="#FF5555"><b>&apos;</b></font>
 =&gt; <font color="#55FFFF"><b>false</b></font> 
2.7.0 :002 &gt; <font color="#FF5555"><b>&apos;</b></font><font color="#AA0000">Temple::Grammar::DefinitelyDoesNotExist</font><font color="#FF5555"><b>&apos;</b></font>.constantize
 =&gt; #&lt;Temple::Mixins::GrammarDSL::Root:0x000055ba28031a50 @grammar=Temple::Grammar, @children=[], @name=:DefinitelyDoesNotExist&gt; 
</pre>


<p>It does!</p>

<p>Any Ruby on Rails application using Haml or Slim that calls <code>constantize</code> on user input (e.g. <code>params[:class].classify.constantize</code>) is vulnerable to a memory leak via this method.</p>

<h3>Restforce</h3>

<p>A very similar code pattern is implemented in the <a href="https://github.com/restforce/restforce">restforce</a> gem.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/restforce/restforce/blob/b14175a9072fb6333c1c1b3dce2bb498c022a1b3/lib/restforce.rb#L65-L67">ErrorCode module</a> uses <code>const_missing</code> like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">module</span> <span class="nn">ErrorCode</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nc">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="nf">const_missing</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">constant_name</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nb">const_set</span> <span class="n">constant_name</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="no">Class</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="no">ResponseError</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Nearly the same, except this actually creates new <em>classes</em>, not just regular objects.</p>

<p>We can verify again:</p>

<pre>Loading development environment (Rails 6.0.3.2)
2.7.0 :001 &gt; require <font color="#FF5555"><b>&apos;</b></font><font color="#AA0000">restforce</font><font color="#FF5555"><b>&apos;</b></font>
 =&gt; <font color="#55FFFF"><b>false</b></font> 
2.7.0 :002 &gt; <font color="#5555FF"><u style="text-decoration-style:single"><b>Restforce</b></u></font>::<font color="#5555FF"><u style="text-decoration-style:single"><b>ErrorCode</b></u></font>::<font color="#5555FF"><u style="text-decoration-style:single"><b>WhateverWeWant</b></u></font>
 =&gt; <font color="#5555FF"><u style="text-decoration-style:single"><b>Restforce</b></u></font>::<font color="#5555FF"><u style="text-decoration-style:single"><b>ErrorCode</b></u></font>::<font color="#5555FF"><u style="text-decoration-style:single"><b>WhateverWeWant</b></u></font> 
</pre>


<p>This time we get as many new classes as we want.</p>

<p><strong>This has been fixed in <a href="https://github.com/restforce/restforce/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#500-jul-10-2020">Restforce 5.0.0</a>.</strong></p>

<h2>Finding and Exploiting Memory Leaks</h2>

<p><em>Finding</em> vulnerable code like this in a production application would be difficult. You would need to guess which parameters might be <code>constantize</code>d.</p>

<p>Verifying that you&#8217;ve found a memory leak is a little tricky and the two memory leaks described above create very minimal objects.</p>

<p>From what I could estimate, a new <code>Rule</code> object in Temple uses about 300 bytes of memory, while a new class in Restforce was taking up almost 1,000 bytes.</p>

<p>Based on that and my testing, it would take 1 to 4 million requests to use just 1GB of memory.</p>

<p>Given that web applications are usually restarted on a regular basis and it&#8217;s not usually a big deal to kill off a process and start a new one, this does not seem particularly impactful.</p>

<p>However, it would be annoying and possibly harmful for smaller sites. For example, the base Heroku instance only has 512MB of memory.</p>

<p>Another note here: Memory leaks are not the worst outcome of an unprotected call to <code>constantize</code>. More likely it can trigger remote code execution. The real issue I am trying to explore here is the unexpected behavior that may be hidden in dependencies.</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>In short: Avoid using <code>constantize</code> in Rails applications. If you need to use it, check against an allowed set of class names <em>before</em> calling <code>constantize</code>. (Calling <code>classify</code> before checking is okay, though.)</p>

<p>Likewise for <code>const_missing</code> in Ruby libraries. Doing anything dynamic with the constant name (loading files, creating new objects, evaluating code, etc.) should be avoided. Ideally, check against an expected list of names and reject anything else.</p>

<p>In the end, this comes down to the security basics of not trusting user input and strictly validating inputs.</p>

<p><em>Edit:</em> It seems some language I used above was a little ambiguous, so I tweaked it. Calling <code>classify</code> does not make the code safe - I meant calling <code>classify</code> is not dangerous by itself. It&#8217;s the subsequent call to <code>constantize</code> that is dangerous. So you can safely call <code>classify</code>, check against a list of allowed classes, then take the appropriate action.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A recent <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/security/advisories/GHSA-65cv-r6x7-79hv">vulnerability report</a> and <a href="https://chefsecure.com/blog/i-found-xss-security-flaws-in-rails-heres-what-happened">the blog post behind it</a> brought my attention back to the <a href="https://api.rubyonrails.org/v6.0.0/classes/ActionView/Helpers/JavaScriptHelper.html#method-i-escape_javascript"><code>escape_javascript</code></a> Ruby on Rails helper method.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Let me say it again&#8230; if you are calling `escape_javascript` or `j` in your Rails code, please don&#39;t! <a href="https://t.co/60KLEjHX3T">https://t.co/60KLEjHX3T</a></p>&mdash; Justin Collins (@presidentbeef) <a href="https://twitter.com/presidentbeef/status/1258917835977318400?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 9, 2020</a></blockquote>


<p> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>It&#8217;s bad form to drop blanket statements without explanation or evidence, so here it is:</p>

<h3>Escaping HTML</h3>

<p>Part of the danger of <code>escape_javascript</code> is the <strong>name</strong> and apparent relationship to <a href="https://api.rubyonrails.org/v6.0.0/classes/ERB/Util.html#method-c-html_escape"><code>html_escape</code></a>.</p>

<p>HTML is a markup language for writing documents. Therefore, it must have a method for representing itself in text.
In other words, there must be a way to encode <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> such that the browser <em>displays</em> <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> and does not interpret it as HTML.</p>

<p>As a result, HTML has a well-defined HTML encoding strategy.
In the context of security and <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross_Site_Scripting_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html">cross-site scripting</a>, if a value output in an HTML context is <em>HTML escaped</em>, it is safe - the value will not be interpreted as HTML.</p>

<p><em>(<a href="https://blog.presidentbeef.com/blog/2020/01/14/injection-prevention-sanitizing-vs-escaping/">See my post all about escaping!</a>)</em></p>

<h3>Escaping Javascript</h3>

<p>On the other hand, JavaScript has no such escaping requirements or capabilities.</p>

<p>Therefore, the &#8220;escaping&#8221; performed by <code>escape_javascript</code> is limited.
The <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/security/advisories/GHSA-65cv-r6x7-79hv">vulnerability report</a> states the method is for &#8220;escaping JavaScript string literals&#8221;.</p>

<p>In particular, <code>escape_javascript</code> is only useful in one, single context: inside JavaScript strings!</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='erb'><span class='line'><span class="x"># ERb Template</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">&lt;script&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">  var x = &#39;</span><span class="cp">&lt;%=</span> <span class="n">escape_javascript</span> <span class="n">some_value</span> <span class="cp">%&gt;</span><span class="x">&#39;;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">&lt;/script&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><strong>Use of <code>escape_javascript</code> in any other context is incorrect and dangerous!</strong></p>

<p>This is and always has been dangerous (note the missing quotes):</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='erb'><span class='line'><span class="x"># ERb Template</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">&lt;script&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">  var x = </span><span class="cp">&lt;%=</span> <span class="n">escape_javascript</span> <span class="n">some_value</span> <span class="cp">%&gt;</span><span class="x">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">&lt;/script&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><code>some_value</code> could be a payload like <code>1; do_something_shady(); //</code> which would result in the following HTML:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;script&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="nx">do_something_shady</span><span class="p">();</span> <span class="c1">//; </span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;/script&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The <code>escape_javascript</code> helper <strong>does not</strong> and <strong>cannot</strong> make arbitrary values inserted into JavaScript &#8220;safe&#8221; in the same way <code>html_escape</code> makes values safe for HTML.</p>

<h3>CVE-2020-5267</h3>

<p><a href="https://chefsecure.com/blog/i-found-xss-security-flaws-in-rails-heres-what-happened">Jesse&#8217;s post</a> has more details, but here&#8217;s the gist: JavaScript added a new string literal. Instead of just single and double-quotes, now there are also backticks <code>`</code> which support string interpolation (like Ruby!).</p>

<p>This meant it was simple to bypass <code>escape_javascript</code> and execute arbitrary JavaScript by using a backtick to break out of the string or just <code>#{...}</code> to execute code during interpolation.</p>

<p>For example, if this were our code:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='erb'><span class='line'><span class="x"># ERb Template</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">&lt;script&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">  var x = `</span><span class="cp">&lt;%=</span> <span class="n">escape_javascript</span> <span class="n">some_value</span> <span class="cp">%&gt;</span><span class="x">`;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">&lt;/script&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Then if <code>some_value</code> had a payload of <code>`; do_something_shady(); //</code>, the resulting HTML would be:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;script&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="err">``</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="nx">do_something_shady</span><span class="p">();</span> <span class="c1">//`</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;/script&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This is because <code>escape_javascript</code> was not aware of backticks for strings.</p>

<h3>Dangers of Dynamic Code Generation</h3>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Let me say it again… using dynamic javascript under practically any circumstance is inviting trouble. It might be ok. I’d rather not have to worry about it. <a href="https://t.co/wnPy3OnkKI">https://t.co/wnPy3OnkKI</a></p>&mdash; Shake, Oreo (@ndm) <a href="https://twitter.com/ndm/status/1258982525172510720?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 9, 2020</a></blockquote>


<p> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>As I have <a href="https://youtu.be/g_24036NDhM">talked about before</a>, web applications are essentially poorly-defined compilers generating code with untrusted inputs.
In the end, the server is just returning a mishmash of code for the browser to interpret.</p>

<p>However, directly trying to generate safe code in a Turing-complete language like JavaScript or Ruby via string manipulation is a risky game.
Methods like <code>escape_javascript</code> make it tempting to do so because the name sounds like it will make the code safe.</p>

<p>If at all possible, avoid dynamic code generation!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>&#8220;We need to sanitize this data&#8221;</em> is a phrase I have heard too many times in the context of web security.
It always makes me a little nervous.</p>

<p>The implication of the term &#8220;sanitize&#8221; is somehow cleaning the data or rendering it &#8220;safe&#8221;.
But the details of how that safety is achieved are a little vague.</p>

<p>Often it means simply searching for a function containing <code>sanitize</code> and blindly using that function.</p>

<p>That is usually the wrong thing!</p>

<h3>Injection Vulnerabilities</h3>

<p>Injection vulnerabilities, including <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10-2017_A7-Cross-Site_Scripting_(XSS)">cross-site scripting</a>, are a <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10-2017_Top_10">top category of web vulnerabilities</a>.</p>

<p>The root cause of injection vulnerabilities is the mixing of code and data which is then handed to a parser (the browser, database driver, shell, etc).
Injection is possible when the data is treated as code.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://youtu.be/g_24036NDhM">See my talk about injection for a deeper dive!</a>)</p>

<p>Since proper escaping or sanitization is the mitigation for injection vulnerabilities, it is important to have a clear understanding of what those terms mean.</p>

<h3>Escaping</h3>

<p>The term &#8220;escaping&#8221; originates from situations where text is being interpreted in some mode
and we want to &#8220;escape&#8221; from that mode into a different mode.</p>

<p>For example, there are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code">ANSI &#8220;escape codes&#8221;</a>
to tell your terminal to switch from a text mode to interpreting a sequence of control characters.</p>

<p>The more common situation is when a developer needs to tell a parser to <em>not</em> interpret a value as code.
For example, when one is writing a string and wants to include a double-quote inside the string:</p>

<pre><code>"blah\"blah"
</code></pre>

<p>The backslash <code>\</code> is an escape character that tells the parser to treat the following character as just a value,
not the end of the string literal.</p>

<p>However, especially in web security, when we say &#8220;escaping&#8221; we typically mean &#8220;encoding&#8221;:</p>

<h3>Encoding</h3>

<p><strong>Encoding</strong> involves replacing special characters with a different representation.</p>

<p>HTML encoding uses <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Entity">HTML entities</a>.</p>

<p>For example, <code>&lt;</code> would normally be interpreted as the start of an HTML tag.
To display a <code>&lt;</code> character without it being interpreted as a tag, use <code>&amp;lt;</code>.</p>

<p>In HTML, <code>&amp;</code> is the escape character. So now you can see how encoding and escaping are intertwined.</p>

<p>In URLs, encoding involves replacing characters with <code>%</code> followed by a hexadecimal number that corresponds
to the ASCII code for that character.</p>

<p>For example, <code>/</code> in a URL would normally be interpreted as a path separator.
To pass in <code>/</code> without it being interpreted that way, use <code>%2F</code>.</p>

<p>This is called &#8220;URL encoding&#8221; or &#8221;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding">percent encoding</a>&#8221; and the <code>%</code> character is the escape character.
The value after <code>%</code> is the hex representation of the ASCII code for the desired display character.</p>

<p>Encoding special characters is typically a very simple and straightforward process.
Characters are simply replaced with their encoded value in a linear fashion.</p>

<p>The encoding scheme used depends on context.
For any type of interpretation (HTML, JavaScript, URLs, CSS, SQL, JSON, &#8230;) there will be a different
encoding scheme. It is important to use the correct encoding for the context.</p>

<p><strong>Also note that encoding is a completely reversible process!</strong>
Given an encoded string, we can easily decode it back to the original value.</p>

<h3>Sanitizing</h3>

<p>Unlike encoding and escaping, <strong>sanitization</strong> involves <em>removing</em> characters entirely in order to make the value &#8220;safe&#8221;.</p>

<p>This is a complicated, error-prone process.</p>

<p>Here is a classic example of bad sanitization:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="c1"># Remove script tags!</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">sanitize_js</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">input</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">input</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">gsub</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sr">/&lt;\/?script&gt;/</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">sanitize_js</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;&lt;script&gt;alert(1)&lt;/script&gt;&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1"># =&gt; &quot;alert(1)&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">sanitize_js</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;&lt;scri&lt;script&gt;pt&gt;alert(1)&lt;/scr&lt;/script&gt;ipt&gt;&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1"># =&gt; &quot;&lt;script&gt;alert(1)&lt;/script&gt;&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This is not just an amusing theoretical example - I have seen this exact approach used in production applications.</p>

<p>Since sanitization is so difficult - nearly impossible - to do correctly, most sanitization implementations have seen
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=html+sanitize+bypass">a number of bypasses</a>.</p>

<p>Also, unlike encoding, sanitization is not reversible!
Information is lost when the data is sanitized.
You cannot retrieve the original input once it has gone through a sanitization process.
This is rarely a desirable side-effect.</p>

<p><em>Sanitization can also mean removal or replacement of sensitive data.
That is a different usage not being discussed here.</em></p>

<h3>Using the Right Approach</h3>

<p>From a security perspective, contextually encoding untrusted values <em>at time of use</em> is the preferred approach.</p>

<p>The tricky part is understanding the output context of the data and which encoding to use.
HTML can easily have more than four different contexts in a single document!
Also, it makes no sense to use HTML encoding in SQL.</p>

<p>When possible, use encoding routines provided by libraries or frameworks.</p>

<p>Sanitization should be reserved for cases when encoding is simply not possible.
For example, if an application must accept and display HTML from users.
There is no way to use encoding in that scenario.</p>

<p>Again, when possible, do not write your own sanitization! Use existing libraries.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>When discussing handling potentially dangerous data, be precise with terms!</p>

<p>The security industry seems to have settled on &#8220;escaping&#8221; to actually mean &#8220;encoding&#8221;.
In other words, a reversible transformation that encodes special characters so
they will not be interpreted as code.</p>

<p>Sanitization, in this context, means an irreversible stripping of special characters.</p>

<p>When possible, prefer encoding/escaping to sanitization!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It started off as a joke&#8230;</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true" data-link-color="#E81C4F"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Just setting up my burner machine for <a href="https://twitter.com/defcon?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@defcon</a> <a href="https://t.co/Dz9pjCBTCo">pic.twitter.com/Dz9pjCBTCo</a></p>&mdash; Justin Collins (@presidentbeef) <a href="https://twitter.com/presidentbeef/status/1144761345847336960?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 29, 2019</a></blockquote>


<p> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I had spent some time <em>several years ago</em> trying to get Linux running on this machine via the (defunct) JLime project,
so I had some of the pieces available to actually get this little &#8220;pocket computer&#8221; going again - mainly
compatible CompactFlash cards and an external card reader.
But I was mostly joking.</p>

<p>Then I starting thinking how funny it would be to actually sit in a talk and take notes at <a href="https://defcon.org/">DEF CON</a> on an ancient &#8220;laptop&#8221;&#8230;</p>

<h3>Battery Power</h3>

<p>The reason I was mostly joking is because the batteries in the 660LX were not working at all.
So, what was I going to do? Plug it into the wall? That&#8217;s just sad, not funny.</p>

<p>I started looking around online for replacement batteries for this machine from 1998.
Despite visiting several rather shady websites, for some reason I was unable to find anyone selling twenty-year-old
laptop batteries.
Some sites claimed to offer a replacement, but from the pictures it was clear they would not work.
The only real possibilities I found were complete sets - a 660LX, manual, cables, etc.
I already had a 660LX, acquired for free, so I really didn&#8217;t want to spend $100+ on another one!
Also, kind of ruins the joke to do so.</p>

<p><em>(Side note: the 660LX has a button battery for backup power. Searching for &#8220;HP 660LX battery&#8221; will return sites trying to sell
you a little CR2032 battery.)</em></p>

<p>Now, I will admit my mental model of a laptop battery was a block of chemical goop inside of some plastic wrap with some wires coming out of it.
After ungracefully disassembling the 660LX battery, I found inside it was just two smaller batteries?!</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/hp_660lx/hp660lx_battery_open.jpg"><img src="/images/blog/hp_660lx/hp660lx_battery_open.jpg" alt="Open battery pack of HP 660LX" /></a></p>

<p>The batteries said &#8220;US18650S SONY ENERGYTEC&#8221; on them.</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/hp_660lx/hp_660lx_old_batteries.jpg"><img src="/images/blog/hp_660lx/hp_660lx_old_batteries.jpg" alt="Sony 18650S Batteries" /></a></p>

<p>While I didn&#8217;t find those exact batteries, some investigation showed the 18650 battery in general is extremely common.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of 18650 - one with &#8220;caps&#8221; (that little nub on the top) and one without.
It seems the ones with caps are safer, as they have an internal circuit to keep them from blowing up.
However, as you can see above, I needed the kind without caps. Presumably the little circuit board
regulates charging the batteries.</p>

<p>The Internet suggested sticking to &#8220;brand name&#8221; batteries, but weirdly Amazon does not carry any of those.
I took a chance on a pack of batteries which reviewers suggested looked like &#8220;genuine&#8221; Samsung batteries.</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/hp_660lx/samsung_18650-30Q_batteries.jpg"><img src="/images/blog/hp_660lx/samsung_18650-30Q_batteries.jpg" alt="Samsung 18650 batteries" /></a></p>

<p>I carefully ripped the old batteries out. The leads from the batteries to the little circuit board were
actually soldered to the batteries, so I pried them off with a screwdriver. Probably not a great idea
unless they are really, truly dead.</p>

<p>With some effort, I shoved the new batteries back in the case and sandwiched the wires back in as well.
I didn&#8217;t bother actually attaching/gluing/soldering anything.</p>

<p>I did, however, scare myself when I generated a terrifying electric arc as I
tried to use a screwdriver to squeeze everything back into the battery case.</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/hp_660lx/hp660lx_batteries_replaced.jpg"><img src="/images/blog/hp_660lx/hp660lx_batteries_replaced.jpg" alt="HP 660LX batteries replaced" /></a></p>

<p>I may have damaged the case just a tiny bit when I gently pried it open,
contributing to it looking slightly sketchy when I tried to close it back up.</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/hp_660lx/hp660lx_battery_together.jpg"><img src="/images/blog/hp_660lx/hp660lx_battery_together.jpg" alt="HP 660LX battery put back together" /></a></p>

<p>But, who cares how it looks&#8230;does it work??</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/hp_660lx/hp660lx_running_on_new_batteries.jpg"><img src="/images/blog/hp_660lx/hp660lx_running_on_new_batteries.jpg" alt="HP 660LX running on battery power" /></a></p>

<p><strong>YES!</strong></p>

<p>Hahahaha now I can walk around using my relic with no wires!</p>

<h3>Software Updates</h3>

<p>Nowadays, a device that can&#8217;t connect to anything does not seem like much fun.</p>

<p>Of course I wanted to hook this Windows CE 2.0 machine up to the Internet!</p>

<p>The HP 660LX has a &#8220;PC CARD&#8221; expansion slot where you can slap in an Ethernet or wireless card,
but of course it is ancient and you have to be careful about compatibility.</p>

<p>Enter <a href="https://www.hpcfactor.com/">HPC: Factor</a>! This is a website/forum full of useful information.
For £10 you can get access to a ton of file downloads (software, drivers, updates) for a year.
Totally worth it.</p>

<p>One thing I learned quickly is that you need the service pack for Windows CE 2.0 and the Network Service Pack
in order to have a chance at getting a wireless card to work.</p>

<p>At this point, I had been transferring files to the 660LX via a compact flash card (which, at 8GB, probably blew the little machine&#8217;s <em>mind</em>).
However, most software for Windows CE requires installation via ActiveSync.</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/hp_660lx/kingston_cf_8gb_card.jpg"><img src="/images/blog/hp_660lx/kingston_cf_8gb_card.jpg" alt="Kingston CompactFlash card" /></a></p>

<p>What is ActiveSync? Well, originally these &#8220;pocket computers&#8221; weren&#8217;t meant to be tiny laptops.
They were more like little helpers you use while you are away from your main machine, then you sync up
files, calendars, email, etc. when you went back to your desk.</p>

<p>ActiveSync was the software used to sync between a pocket computer and your main machine.</p>

<p>Now, for Windows CE 2.0, the recommended version of ActiveSync is 3.8. The very <em>newest</em> operating system
supported by ActiveSync 3.8 is Windows XP.</p>

<p>By pure luck, I had an old Windows XP laptop and I was able to install ActiveSync!</p>

<p><strong>BUT</strong>&#8230; you need a special serial cable to hook up the 660LX.
At first I poked around eBay, but no luck. Yet, in the back of my mind,
I was <em>pretty</em> sure I still had that cable somewhere. I searched all around my office and
dug through my big box of (mostly useless) cables,
but still no luck.</p>

<p>Just when I gave up (of course) I found it!! Yay!!</p>

<p><strong>BUT</strong>&#8230; turns out I don&#8217;t have a serial port on my Windows XP laptop.</p>

<p>I thought about trying a Windows XP virtual machine on my main Linux box, but it doesn&#8217;t have a serial port, either!
None of my machines had an infrared port, either.</p>

<p>After first buying the wrong cable on Amazon, I got an RS-232 to USB adapter and a tiny, tiny CD with drivers.
Luckily, the laptop has a CD drive, so I was able to actually install the proper drivers.</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/hp_660lx/usb_to_serial_cable.jpg"><img src="/images/blog/hp_660lx/usb_to_serial_cable.jpg" alt="USB to serial cable" /></a></p>

<p>After an uncomfortable amount of configuration twiddling&#8230; they connected!!</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/hp_660lx/active_sync_connected.jpg"><img src="/images/blog/hp_660lx/active_sync_connected.jpg" alt="ActiveSync is connected" /></a></p>

<p>I was then able to install Windows CE 2.0 SP1 and the CE Network Service Pack.</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/hp_660lx/install_ce_sp1.jpg"><img src="/images/blog/hp_660lx/install_ce_sp1.jpg" alt="Installing Windows CE SP1" /></a></p>

<h3>Networking</h3>

<p>One of my criteria for this project was to <em>not spend much money on a joke</em>.</p>

<p>After spending some time looking around, I bought a $20 wireless adapter off of eBay.
$20 was really right at the limit of my per-item budget.</p>

<p>In the meantime, though, I found out there was another way to access the Internet.</p>

<p>Turns out you can &#8220;share&#8221; the networking connection on the main machine with the 660LX
over the serial cable, via ActiveSync.</p>

<p>The only weird bit is that you need to run a proxy server on the main machine to route
the connection to the Internet.</p>

<p>In the modern world, that is not a problem. In the land of Windows XP, however, I was not sure I would be able to get something working.
I found <a href="https://www.youngzsoft.net/ccproxy/windows-proxy-server.htm">CCProxy</a>, which did work, despite its awful and confusing interface.</p>

<p>Configured the proxy for &#8220;The Internet&#8221; on the 660LX and&#8230;</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/hp_660lx/hp660lx_accessing_google.jpg"><img src="/images/blog/hp_660lx/hp660lx_accessing_google.jpg" alt="Accessing Google via Pocket Explorer" /></a></p>

<p>Wow! The Internet!</p>

<p>Sadly&#8230; or not so sadly&#8230; the world has moved to HTTPS and to stronger protocols than what
lowly Pocket Explorer supports. Thus, most of the web is entirely inaccessible on the device.</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/hp_660lx/hp660lx_failure_to_access_github.jpg"><img src="/images/blog/hp_660lx/hp660lx_failure_to_access_github.jpg" alt="Failure to access sites over HTTPS" /></a></p>

<p>As a result, when the eBay seller canceled my order for the wireless adapter, I figured &#8220;meh&#8221;.
Even if you can get WiFi working (which would likely require connecting to a totally unsecured network),
there&#8217;s not much of the web that one can even visit.</p>

<p>Yes, it would be possible to use an SSL stripper, etc., but I didn&#8217;t want to go through the hassle of setting
that up on Windows XP.</p>

<h3>Wrapping Up</h3>

<p><a href="/images/blog/hp_660lx/the_whole_setup.jpg"><img src="/images/blog/hp_660lx/the_whole_setup.jpg" alt="The whole setup" /></a></p>

<p>This turned into more of a narrative than a how-to guide.
Maybe I&#8217;ll do another write-up with the details.
In the meantime, I can try to answer questions about specifics.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="https://github.com/seattlerb/ruby_parser/">RubyParser</a> is a library written by <a href="http://www.zenspider.com/">Ryan Davis</a> for parsing Ruby code and producing an abstract syntax tree. It is used by <a href="https://brakemanscanner.org/">Brakeman</a> and several other static analysis gems.</p>

<p>Recently I was poking around to see if there was any low-hanging fruit for performance improvements.
At first, I was interested in the generated parsers. Racc outputs some <em>crazy</em> arrays of state machine changes.
Instead of generating arrays of integers, it outputs arrays of strings, then splits those strings into integers which it loads into the final array.
I thought for sure skipping this and starting with the final array of integers would be faster, but&#8230;somehow it wasn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>I moved on to thinking about <a href="https://wyeworks.com/blog/2015/12/1/immutable-strings-in-ruby-2-dot-3">frozen string literals</a>, which led me to checking String allocations.</p>

<h3>Measuring String Allocations</h3>

<p>I found the <a href="https://github.com/srawlins/allocation_stats">allocation_stats</a> gem very useful for this.</p>

<p>I set up a test like this to read in a file and parse it:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>This outputs a report like this (truncated here):</p>

<pre><code>                    sourcefile                      sourceline  count

<p>Right away, these look like some juicy targets.</p>

<h3>Version Creation</h3>

<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at the first one:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>On line 8 you can see the <code>Parser.version</code> method. RubyParser is actually not just one parser, but multiple parsers for different versions of Ruby.
So there is a <code>RubyParser</code> class but also <code>Ruby18Parser</code>, <code>Ruby19Parser</code>, etc. <em>and</em> <code>RubyParser::V18</code>, <code>RubyParser::V19</code>, etc.
To figure out the version of the current class, the code above grabs the version from the class name itself.</p>

<p>The problem is this code is called <em>a lot</em> (70k+ in the example above) to make version-specific decisions during the lexing phase.
This is <a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/ruby_parser/commit/7274aa6df023981fc3c375a9d22bcde781f2cc3f">fairly easy to fix</a>.</p>

<p>In my testing, this <strong>reduced string allocations by ~25% and parse time by 5-10%.</strong>
One thing I have noticed - and you may also find if you go chasing object allocations in Ruby programs - is that reducing allocations doesn&#8217;t necessarily help with peak memory use or run time.
It seems the Ruby VM has gotten pretty good at allocating and garbage collecting objects efficiently.</p>

<h3>Debug Code</h3>

<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at the next two large number of String allocations:</p>

<pre><code>                    sourcefile                      sourceline  count
--------------------------------------------------  ----------  -----
&lt;GEM:ruby_parser-3.11.0&gt;/lib/ruby_parser_extras.rb        1361  58154
&lt;GEM:ruby_parser-3.11.0&gt;/lib/ruby_parser_extras.rb        1362  54672
</code></pre>

<p>Interesting: just two lines apart, with over 100k allocations between them.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">push</span> <span class="n">val</span>

</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nb">warn</span> <span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">_stack(push): </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="n">val</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2"> at line </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="n">c</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">clean_caller</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">debug</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="kp">nil</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The two lines of interest are 3 and 4 - the assignments to the local variable <code>c</code>, which pull information from <code>caller</code>.
<code>caller</code> is a fairly expensive method, since it needs to generate a stack trace for the current method call.</p>

<p>Upon a closer look, it&#8217;s clear the <code>c</code> variable is only used in the message on the following line, and that message is only used if the <code>debug</code> flag is set.
This means we can wrap all that code in a condition, like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This change <strong>saves 38-50% on string allocations and 20-26% on parse time.</strong></p>

<h3>Reading Lines</h3>

<p>Skipping down a few unavoidable string allocations, there&#8217;s this one:</p>

<pre><code>                    sourcefile                      sourceline  count
--------------------------------------------------  ----------  -----
&lt;GEM:ruby_parser-3.11.0&gt;/lib/ruby_parser_extras.rb        1015   6818
</code></pre>

<p>Here&#8217;s the code:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">header</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">str</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">lines</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">first</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>RubyParser checks the first couple lines of a file for any comments setting the encoding for the file. The trouble is that calling <code>String#lines</code> will split the entire string up when we only need the first two lines.</p>

<p>Grabbing only the first two lines ends up being pretty trivial thanks to Ruby&#8217;s standard approach of returning enumerators for enumeration methods if a block is not supplied:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">header</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">str</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">each_line</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">first</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><code>String#each_line</code> will lazily return the lines from the string, so it only does the work needed.</p>

<p>Sadly, this didn&#8217;t do much for overall string allocations and parse time since this method is only called once, but I think it&#8217;s a clear improvement to only grab the two lines needed.</p>

<h3>Freezing Strings</h3>

<p>Finally, back to the original idea. By the time I made it back to freezing string literals, I was feeling pretty lazy, so I just threw the frozen string header on <a href="https://github.com/seattlerb/ruby_parser/blob/dd2adeca68471a2de7a8d541fb145972f3e3494f/lib/ruby_lexer.rb"><code>ruby_lexer.rb</code></a>:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="c1"># frozen_string_literal: true</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Running the tests showed only one method where frozen string literals did not work, so these strings needed to be <code>dup</code>ed.</p>

<p>String allocations were reduced by 24-30%, but with almost no parse time change. Probably because these were tiny, tiny strings.</p>

<h3>Final Metrics</h3>

<p>With these four changes, <strong>string allocations were reduced by 75-83% and parse time was reduced by 30-37%.</strong> The test suite for RubyParser ran 33% faster on my machine.</p>

<p>I did not see a huge decrease in peak memory use. Maybe 3%. My guess is this is because the String representation in Ruby is fairly well-optimized already (e.g. copy-on-write).</p>

<p>For Brakeman, parsing is a decent part of the run time (30-60% even), so a faster RubyParser definitely makes Brakeman scans faster. From a few test scans, I saw as much as a 30% improvement in total scan time.</p>

<h3>Final Changes</h3>

<p>The final version of the changes applied by Ryan are in <a href="https://github.com/seattlerb/ruby_parser/commit/358e5a058e1eca75c6d6ab075ae31c2cc44827a5">this commit</a>.</p>

<p>I expect these improvements will be in the next RubyParser and Brakeman releases.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Pricing in the static analysis security tool (SAST) world is difficult. Do you charge per project? Per repository? Per line of code? Per language? Per user? What defines a &#8220;user&#8221;?
None of these approaches are very satisfying, because no single approach will cover all types of customers.</p>

<p>Instead, companies come up with per-customer pricing. Meaning they will look at a potential customer&#8217;s needs and size, and then come up with a number they think the customer might be willing to pay.</p>

<p>Then the negotation dance begins, where the customer attempts to talk the seller down 20-50% from the initial quote (which was kind of made up anyway).</p>

<p>To me, that&#8217;s stressful, time-consuming, and a little shady.</p>

<p>Personally, I do not want to deal with salespeople (and their relentless follow up emails/calls) just to get a rough idea of what a product will cost.</p>

<p>With Brakeman Pro, I wanted to be upfront and honest with customers. That&#8217;s why, as far as I know, we are the only commercial SAST with <a href="https://brakemanpro.com/purchase/pricing">publicly-available pricing</a>.</p>

<p>Want to purchase a license? You can buy with a credit card on the website and you never have to talk to anyone! That is the kind of interaction I like to have with a company - not &#8220;request a quote&#8221; or &#8220;contact us for pricing&#8221;.</p>

<p>Does that mean we make less money than if we had hidden price lists and made up numbers based on what we think a customer would pay? Almost certainly. Our customers range from companies making billions per year to individual users. It would be &#8220;smarter&#8221; to have the large companies pay more.</p>

<p>But the &#8220;mission&#8221; of the company is not to maximize profit. It is to fund development of a security product that will <em>help make the world a little safer</em>.</p>

<p>That is why it has been more important to me that we focus on number of customers, rather than overall revenue.</p>

      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>It has been roughly three years since the ball began rolling on <a href="https://brakemanpro.com/">Brakeman Pro</a> (the commercial version of the <a href="http://brakemanscanner.org/">Brakeman</a> security tool for Ruby on Rails), and it has been a little over a year since Brakeman Pro actually <a href="https://brakemanpro.com/blog/announcement/2015/11/18/brakeman-pro-is-available">went on sale</a>. I have learned a ton in that time (and I am still having lessons beaten into me). There have been a ton of challenges going from an OSS project that was never meant to be a paid product to one people are actually buying. Here are just a couple I have much time thinking about:</p>

<h2>The &#8220;Free&#8221; Version</h2>

<p>Clearly, what makes building a commercial product on top of an OSS project different from just selling some software is the existing OSS project itself.</p>

<p>With an OSS project, there is an opportunity to acquire a large number of people testing the software in many different environments. For a static analysis tool like Brakeman, testing on a wide variety of codebases is incredibly valuable. OSS with easy bug reporting and contributing (e.g. a GitHub repo) is not only very likely to receive bug reports and patches, but also suggestions for features and improvements. Brakeman does not receive a large number of code contributions, but bug reports and suggestions for new rules have driven a large chunk of Brakeman’s development.</p>

<p>Being free and open source also makes it easier to advertise your project. People are more willing to promote free software and you can share it around social media with little fear of backlash. Not to mention it is vastly easier to give  conference talks about open source tools!</p>

<p>Personally, I will forever be grateful to the OSS community. Being the main author of widely-used (within a small niche) software has propelled most of my career, led to me speaking all over the world, and has brought me acquaintances and friends I would not have otherwise. I am very glad Brakeman is open source and I would never want to change that.</p>

<p>However, the existence of a &#8220;free&#8221; version, especially a successful one, has a serious drawback for a business. In particular, <strong>the &#8220;paid&#8221; version must now not only justify its utility, but also the <em>incremental</em> advantage over the free version.</strong> It has become abundantly clear the biggest competitor to Brakeman Pro is Brakeman OSS!</p>

<p>The number one question I receive regarding Brakeman Pro is &#8220;What is the difference between Pro and the open source version?&#8221; Among other things, one very simple, easy-to-explain difference is the existence of a <a href="https://brakemanpro.com/features#dt">GUI</a>. However, most people want to know if it will &#8220;find more things.&#8221; This leads to considerable hedging from me because Pro probably will find <em>different</em> vulnerabilities while also reducing <em>some</em> false positives - the net outcome of which may be more or fewer overall warnings. Explaining why Pro may report different vulnerabilities quickly gets me lost in fine details of how the two tools work - at which point people&#8217;s eyes tend to glaze over.</p>

<p>Trying to quantify the differences between the OSS and Pro versions is a losing battle for me. Potential customers try to add up all these little details and see if it comes out to enough of a difference to begin paying for software they are used to having for free. But, as a technical person, papering over the differences with hyperbolic qualitative statements can seem dishonest. I have yet to arrive at a good solution for this problem.</p>

<h2>Existing User Base</h2>

<p>With a well-established OSS project comes another big advantage: the existing user base. These users already like the project and have found it useful! In a way, they have validated a market exists for the product. In the case of Brakeman, I have also felt a tremendous amount of goodwill from the community (for which, again, I am incredibly thankful).</p>

<p>These users are going to be the <em>very first</em> people in line to try the commercial product.* They will already be familiar with the OSS version - therefore communicating and justifying the <em>additional</em> value of the commercial version will be critical. The good news is they already know what the product does and have found it valuable. In some cases (but not very many, I’ve found) they may even purchase the product just to support the OSS version. In most cases, though, people need to justify why they are spending budget on this particular software instead of using the free version.</p>

<p><strong>If you are like me, you may also find this existing user base to be a source of stress.</strong> Marketing to OSS users often feels scummy, but it also makes no sense not to promote the commercial tool to the people already using the free version! For quite a while I did not want to take advantage of the existing audience at all. I have only made very small steps in that direction, preceded by a lot of thought. The last thing I want to do is alienate the community or burn any of the goodwill Brakeman has.</p>

<p>One way to push customers towards the commercial version is to make the OSS version obviously <em>worse</em>. But while it would make selling the commercial version easier, not working on or supporting the OSS version is unthinkable. Even the appearance of doing so could turn a community against you. When your potential customers are mostly developers the support of the developer community has extreme value. Besides the business aspect, I personally would have a hard time dealing with loss of the community when the community has done so much for me.</p>

<p>That leaves making the commercial version <em>so much better</em> than the OSS version the additional value is ridiculously obvious and people happily pay for it. Sadly (gladly?), many people have let me know &#8220;the free version of Brakeman is really good and already does all I need.&#8221; Making the Pro version <em>extra awesome</em> without hurting the OSS version is an ongoing struggle which I continue to hope will resolve itself over time as we continue to improve Pro.</p>

<p>Like many things, the existing user base for an OSS project has both advantages and disadvantages which need to be considered and kept in mind if one is going to turn the project into a commercial product.</p>

<h2>As a Security Tool&#8230;</h2>

<p>This probably does not apply to very many projects, but as a security tool Brakeman has additional issues related to those above. With every feature that might be exclusive to Pro, I must consider - <strong>&#8220;Am I making the world <em>less safe</em> by not adding this feature to the OSS version?&#8221;</strong> The answers to this question likely lead me to make terrible business decisions. In the end I can live without Brakeman Pro being a successful business, but consciously compromising my integrity and potentially the security of applications is not something I could personally handle.</p>

<p>As a result, the features that tend to go into Pro but not the OSS version are noisier, slower, or focused on ease of use and not actual vulnerability discovery. I believe more false positives (but potentially more true positives) are acceptable in the Pro version because we make it easy to triage and ignore them. Slower features are also much more acceptable in the Pro version - the OSS version needs to be fast and lean. (Sometimes these features also end up in OSS, just off by default. &#8220;Off by default&#8221; means they might as well not exist for most users.)</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>If you are considering taking an open source project and building a commercial tool on top of it, I hope this little post has given you some (perhaps less obvious?) issues to ponder. For Brakeman users, I hope this explains a little bit of the thinking I have done while trying to balance between OSS and Pro.</p>

<p>Note that this blog post is actually an example of the first two issues above: I had to tell you about the &#8220;free&#8221; version to talk about the Pro version and at the same time you probably feel like this is a bit of an advertisement for the Pro version!</p>

<p>(I think I have to plug my product here now? <a href="https://brakemanpro.com/">Brakeman Pro is a static analysis security tool for Ruby on Rails applications</a>. <a href="https://brakemanpro.com/purchase/pricing">Try it out for free</a>.)</p>

<hr />

<p>* <em>One of the early mistakes I made with Brakeman Pro was not realizing who the first customers would be. I thought the people most willing to <em>buy</em> a tool would be security auditors, and so the tool and pricing were targeted at <em>security professionals</em>. Unfortunately, the much larger market and initial user base for Brakeman are developers. Brakeman Pro should have made developers our top priority from the beginning just like Brakeman OSS does.</em></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3>Backstory</h3>

<p>I recently decided to distribute the <a href="http://brakemanscanner.org/">Brakeman</a> gem with all its dependencies included.
This was the culmination of a lot of frustration with <a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/issues/659">Bundler</a>, <a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/issues/709">version conflicts</a>, <a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/issues/767#issuecomment-180964293">RubyGem bugs</a>, and trying to maintain compatibility with older versions of Ruby <a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/602#issuecomment-69494355">while libraries did not</a>.</p>

<p>Brakeman is most often used as an <em>application</em>, not a library. Yet most Rubyists are used to including <em>all</em> dependencies in a <code>Gemfile</code> for use with Bundler.
Doing so causes Brakeman&#8217;s dependencies to be mixed in with users&#8217; application dependencies, which doesn&#8217;t make sense and causes a lot of anguish.</p>

<p>I liken it to having to worry about whether or not your Rails application&#8217;s dependencies conflict with your browser&#8217;s. It shouldn&#8217;t matter.</p>

<p>However, Bundler does not have a way to isolate dependencies for applications like Brakeman, and Bundler is the best way to manage dependencies so we are stuck with it.</p>

<p>Since Brakeman is not normally loaded into users&#8217; applications (and I recommend against doing so), its dependencies are separate and should not really matter to the end user.
To this end, I wanted to distribute Brakeman with all its dependencies already inside the gem.</p>

<h3>Bundling Dependencies</h3>

<p>Conveniently, Bundler already has a way to do this: <code>bundle install --standalone</code>.
This generates a <code>bundle</code> directory with two subdirectories <code>bundler</code> and <code>ruby</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>bundler</code> directory just has one file: <code>setup.rb</code>. This file adds the bundled gems to the load path. We&#8217;ll come back to this file later.</p>

<p>The <code>ruby</code> directory has everything you need to run Bundler, along with all of the bundled gems and their executables.
The path to the gems looks something like <code>ruby/2.3.0/gems/rake-10.1.1/</code>.
Note this includes the Ruby version and the gem&#8217;s version.
When <code>setup.rb</code> sets up the library paths, it chooses dynamically based on the running Ruby implementation and version (which is not what we want, see below).</p>

<h3>Adding Dependencies</h3>

<p>All the dependencies are now there in the <code>bundle/</code> directory, but it&#8217;s still assumed you will be using Bundler.
I would prefer to just load the dependencies myself.</p>

<p>To do so, the Brakeman build script removes the <code>bundle/bundler/setup.rb</code> file and generates its own <code>load.rb</code> using similar logic.
However, it does not build paths dependent on the running Ruby version because we don&#8217;t know what the end user will be using.
Instead, it just globs the paths as they are and loads those.</p>

<p>In Brakeman itself, it loads <code>bundle/load.rb</code> <a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/blob/fb4f9de160fd97a2b72d5e01c16058718941ec3d/lib/brakeman.rb#L431-L439">lazily</a> if the file exists. I do not use it in normal testing or development.
In general, all that is needed is to <code>require</code> the <code>load.rb</code> file inside your code somewhere.</p>

<h3>Building the Gem</h3>

<p>All that is left to do is add the bundled gems to the Brakeman gem itself.</p>

<p>Note that Brakeman&#8217;s Gemfile relies on its gemspec, but the gemspec needs to rely on the bundled gems, leading to a circular dependency.</p>

<p>This simple code is all that is required in the gemspec:</p>

<pre><code>if File.exist? 'bundle/load.rb'
  s.files += Dir['bundle/ruby/*/gems/**/*'] + ['bundle/load.rb']
else
  # add dependencies as normal
end
</code></pre>

<h3>Pros</h3>

<p>The main advantage of this approach is not polluting application dependencies!
No more version conflicts! No more worries that weird Bundler or gem bugs will break users&#8217; installs.</p>

<p>In theory it also makes it easier to distribute Brakeman as a standalone application, if someone were interested in that.</p>

<h3>Cons</h3>

<p>The main problem, of course, is that this hides the dependencies.
If you add Brakeman as a dependency and then either load it programmatically or run it with Rake, you may get mysterious library conflicts.
To avoid this, use the &#8221;<a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/brakeman-lib">brakeman-lib</a>&#8221; gem, which is the same as the main Brakeman gem but does not bundle dependencies.</p>

<p>It also locks dependencies to a specific version such that updating dependencies requires a new release.
This can be good (avoid breaking with new versions) but it can also be bad if a library has a bug or vulnerability.</p>

<h3>Code</h3>

<p>The script I use to build the main Brakeman gem is <a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/blob/fb4f9de160fd97a2b72d5e01c16058718941ec3d/build.rb">here</a>.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the annotated version:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env ruby
puts 'Packaging Brakeman gem...'

# Clean up any existing build artifacts
system 'rm -rf bundle Gemfile.lock brakeman-*.gem' and

# Generate gem bundle in ./bundle
system 'BM_PACKAGE=true bundle install --standalone'

abort "No bundle installed" unless Dir.exist? 'bundle'

# Remove the setup.rb file we don't use
File.delete "bundle/bundler/setup.rb"
Dir.delete "bundle/bundler"

# Generate new file to set load paths
# Code below is a little confusing because it is generating code
File.open "bundle/load.rb", "w" do |f|

  # Set path at runtime
  f.puts "path = File.expand_path('../..', __FILE__)"

  # Add each gem's lib/ directory to the load path (again at runtime)
  Dir["bundle/ruby/**/lib"].each do |dir|
    f.puts %Q[$:.unshift "\#{path}/#{dir}"]
  end
end

# Build the gem
system "BM_PACKAGE=true gem build brakeman.gemspec"
</code></pre>

<p>When bundling gems and building the gem, the script sets the <code>BM_PACKAGE</code> variable so that development dependencies <a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/blob/fb4f9de160fd97a2b72d5e01c16058718941ec3d/brakeman.gemspec#L22">are not included</a> in the bundled gems.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am not sure this is a problem everyone has, but I grew tired of people commenting on old, resolved GitHub issues.
Almost every time someone would comment &#8220;I have this problem, too&#8221; it would actually be a different issue. Then I&#8217;d
go through the routine of asking them to open a new issue with details about their specific problem.
Sometimes they would, and sometimes they&#8217;d never come back.</p>

<p>Fortunately, right around the time I decided I should do something about this annoyance, <a href="https://developer.github.com/changes/2016-02-11-issue-locking-api/">GitHub released an API</a>
to lock issues. (<a href="https://github.com/blog/1847-locking-conversations">Locking issues or pull requests</a> prevents any new comments except from repo collaborators.)</p>

<p>So I put together a little gem called <a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/github-auto-locker">github-auto-locker</a> to fetch and lock old, closed issues.</p>

<p>To install it (requires Ruby):</p>

<pre><code>gem install github-auto-locker
</code></pre>

<p>Then run:</p>

<pre><code>github-auto-locker USER REPO TOKEN [age in days]
</code></pre>

<p>For example, I run this to lock resolved issues over 60 days old:</p>

<pre><code>github-auto-locker presidentbeef brakeman N0TM1R34L70K3N 60
</code></pre>

<p>The default is 120 days.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been running it periodically myself since February without any complaints.
Perhaps it will be useful to you!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Readers%E2%80%93writer_lock">readers-writer lock</a> can be used to allow many concurrent read-only operations on a resource but ensure exclusive access for modifying operations performed by &#8220;writers&#8221;. For my purposes, I needed a readers-writer lock at the thread level, basically to control access to a shared array. In my scenario, the array is accessed through a server which may server many clients at once. Some requests will be to read elements from the array, while other requests might be adding elements to the array. There is no reason to restrict reads to one client at a time, but elements need to be added while no other client is reading or writing to the array.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/rwlock">My implementation</a> is very simple (the entire <code>RWLock</code> class is 25 lines of code) because it relies on Ruby&#8217;s <a href="http://rdoc.info/stdlib/thread/SizedQueue">SizedQueue</a> class. <code>SizedQueue</code> provides a thread-safe queue with a maximum size. If a thread attempts to add elements to a queue that is full, it will be blocked until an element is removed from the queue to make room. This is a key piece of funtionality used for the readers-writer lock implementation.</p>

<p>The <code>RWLock</code> class only really needs to provide two methods: one to provide read access, and one to provide write access. Since this is Ruby, the methods will take a block to execute the reading/writing code:</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The internal state of the lock will be a <code>SizedQueue</code> and a <code>Mutex</code>.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The <code>SizedQueue</code> will essentially be used as a counting semaphore. Each time a reader enters <code>read_sync</code>, the lock will push an element onto the queue. What the element actually is doesn&#8217;t matter, but I used <code>true</code> because it&#8217;s cheap. If the queue is full, the reader will block until a space has opened up.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>When a writer calls <code>write_sync</code>, it synchronizes on the mutex to prevent multiple concurrent writers. Then it adds <em>n</em> elements to the queue, where <em>n</em> is equal to the maximum size of the queue.</p>

<p>This has two effects: first, the writer is forced to wait for all current readers to finish. Second, it essentially prevents any new readers from gaining access (there is a small chance one will sneak in, but the writer will still have to wait for it).</p>

<p>Once the writer is finished, the queue is cleared, allowing all waiting readers to jump in. It is most likely waiting readers will get in before waiting writers, since the write mutex is held while the queue is emptied, but no effort is made to guarantee that one way or another. In practice, though, this seems to balance well between readers and writers.</p>

<p>One obvious downside of this overall approach is the <code>SizedQueue</code> limits the number of concurrent readers. A larger queue will cause writers to wait longer (assuming many readers) while a smaller queue may cause readers to wait on other readers. The upside is readers cannot monopolize the resource and cause writer starvation.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, <code>SizedQueue#clear</code> has been broken forever, since it was simply inherited from <code>Queue</code> and didn&#8217;t actually notify waiting threads that the queue is empty. For some reason, this does not appear to matter in Ruby 1.8, but in Ruby 1.9 and 2.0 it caused a deadlock.</p>

<p>This has been fixed in Ruby 1.9.3p545 and 2.1.1. For broken versions, the <code>RWLock</code> gem monkey-patches <code>SizedQueue</code> to fix the behavior. Unfortunately, Ruby 2.0 also had a bug in <code>SizedQueue#push</code>, so it is completely incompatible. The code does work under JRuby, but there are faster implementations using Java primitives.</p>

<p>RWLock is available as <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/rwlock">a gem</a> and of course the <a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/rwlock">code is on GitHub</a>.</p>
