    <p>I am not sure this is a problem everyone has, but I grew tired of people commenting on old, resolved GitHub issues.
Almost every time someone would comment “I have this problem, too” it would actually be a different issue. Then I’d
go through the routine of asking them to open a new issue with details about their specific problem.
Sometimes they would, and sometimes they’d never come back.</p>

<p>Fortunately, right around the time I decided I should do something about this annoyance, <a href="https://developer.github.com/changes/2016-02-11-issue-locking-api/">GitHub released an API</a>
to lock issues. (<a href="https://github.com/blog/1847-locking-conversations">Locking issues or pull requests</a> prevents any new comments except from repo collaborators.)</p>

<p>So I put together a little gem called <a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/github-auto-locker">github-auto-locker</a> to fetch and lock old, closed issues.</p>

<p>To install it (requires Ruby):</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>gem install github-auto-locker
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then run:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>github-auto-locker USER REPO TOKEN [age in days]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For example, I run this to lock resolved issues over 60 days old:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>github-auto-locker presidentbeef brakeman N0TM1R34L70K3N 60
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The default is 120 days.</p>

<p>I’ve been running it periodically myself since February without any complaints.
Perhaps it will be useful to you!</p>
