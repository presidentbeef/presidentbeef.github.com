None of these approaches are very satisfying, because no single approach will cover all types of customers.</p>

<p>Instead, companies come up with per-customer pricing. Meaning they will look at a potential customer’s needs and size, and then come up with a number they think the customer might be willing to pay.</p>

<p>Then the negotation dance begins, where the customer attempts to talk the seller down 20-50% from the initial quote (which was kind of made up anyway).</p>

<p>To me, that’s stressful, time-consuming, and a little shady.</p>

<p>Personally, I do not want to deal with salespeople (and their relentless follow up emails/calls) just to get a rough idea of what a product will cost.</p>

<p>With Brakeman Pro, I wanted to be upfront and honest with customers. That’s why, as far as I know, we are the only commercial SAST with <a href="https://brakemanpro.com/purchase/pricing">publicly-available pricing</a>.</p>

<p>Want to purchase a license? You can buy with a credit card on the website and you never have to talk to anyone! That is the kind of interaction I like to have with a company - not “request a quote” or “contact us for pricing”.</p>

<p>Does that mean we make less money than if we had hidden price lists and made up numbers based on what we think a customer would pay? Almost certainly. Our customers range from companies making billions per year to individual users. It would be “smarter” to have the large companies pay more.</p>

<p>But the “mission” of the company is not to maximize profit. It is to fund development of a security product that will <em>help make the world a little safer</em>.</p>

<p>That is why it has been more important to me that we focus on number of customers, rather than overall revenue.</p>
